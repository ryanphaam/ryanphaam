## About Me
Ever since a kid, I've always been fascinated with problem-solving and critical thinking. My senior year of high school, I gave computer science a try and became very interested in it. Currently, I'm majoring in computer science and business administration in hopes of pursuing a career in tech consulting or venturing out to the distant lands of California start-ups. Additionally, I like to watch psychological movies. Specifically, I began this movie journey with cool films like *American Psycho* (2000) and *Fight Club* (1999). Here's my current favorite movie photo:

## Skills
Good communicator, leader, and problem-solver. At the end of the day, these are the three skills I try to embody every day. Additionally, I can speak (almost) 3 languages: English, Vietnamese, and Spanish. A niche skill I have is I'm a fairly good artist so hit me up for commissions. Also, I've played volleyball for 5 years, so I'm no stranger to the courts!

### Classes
I've learned the basics of object oriented programming in my time at UNC-Chapel Hill. With classes like COMP 110 and COMP 210 to teach me the foundations of both Python and Java, I have a good understanding of object oriented programming and general coding knowledge. Additionally, I'm taking COMP 290 which is helping me learn the tools associated with software engineering such as Docker and Git. Shoutout to the CS Department, you guys are the best!
